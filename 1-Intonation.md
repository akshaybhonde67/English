### 1. Word Stress in sentence position

Stressed words are the content words:  nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives.  But with that in mind, different people will stress differently.  There's no one right way to stress.<br>
You can skip the T between two other consonants.  So it's ok to skip in a phrase like 'just dance' or a word like 'exactly'.<br>
In general American English goes does in pitch in a sentence.<br>

eg. 
	I'll be "home"(more pitch, more volume, more stress)  by 3. 
    Last night I drove the car "home"(low pitch, low in volume, low stress).
    
### 2. Stress a syllable

glides from low to high to low instead of being flat eg hello, yes, yes-ter-day
practice sentence underpaced gliding from pitch to pitch eg Hey, how are you?
then speed it up (but dont switch to speaking mode) by taking the stretched, gliding from pitch to pitch speech and speed that up

### 3. Word stress in statements vs questions

eg. 
	statement - I'll(high) be there by three(low)
	question - Have(low) you seen Mary?(high)
   
eg. 
	you(high) know what I mean(low) - statement
	you(low) know what I mean(high)? - question
   
   same word but stressing at different positions can make it a statement or a question
   
eg.
	someone asks - who can help me tomorrow? you say - me (statement - it means you can help them) voice goes down in pitch
	someone stares at you and says - who can help me tomorrow? you say - me? (question - you are like are they asking you specifically 
                                                                  and you want to confirm so you ask a question) voice goes up in pitch

eg. 
	see you tomorrow (statement)(high to low)
	see you tomorrow? (question)(low to high)

Figure out the word stress and answer if its a statement or question
	you're coming at three? - question
	he saw her yesterday - statement
	we're going - statement
    we're going? - question
    They said no - statement
	we'll see them monday? - question
   
### 4. Questions & intonation - up or down?

How to know the intonation of questions?  Yes/no questions go up in pitch at the end, while other questions go down in pitch.  
questions starting with did, do/does, is, can go up in pitch
all other questions go down in pitch

eg.
	did you go to the party(up)? 
	what did you bring to the party(down)?
	did you pick up the groceries(up)?
	does the store open up at one(up)?
	can you lend me a dollar(up)?
	how are you(down)?
	why did you leave(down)?
	where are the keys(down)?
	who are you calling(down)?
	which one did you buy(down)?
	can I borrow your book(up)?
	where is your book(down)?
	did you go to the show(up)?
	how was the show(down)?
