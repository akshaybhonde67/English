Stressed words are the content words:  nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives.  But with that in mind, different people will stress differently.  There's no one right way to stress. 
You can skip the T between two other consonants.  So it's ok to skip in a phrase like 'just dance' or a word like 'exactly'.  
In general American English goes does in pitch in a sentence.
eg. I'll be "home"(more pitch, more volume, more stress)  by 3. 
    Last night I drove the car "home"(low pitch, low in volume, low stress).
